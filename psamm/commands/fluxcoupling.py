    This identifies any reaction pairs where the flux of one reaction
    constrains the flux of another reaction. The reactions can be coupled in
    three distinct ways depending on the ratio between the reaction fluxes.
    The reactions can be fully coupled (the ratio is static and non-zero);
    partially coupled (the ratio is bounded and non-zero); or directionally
    coupled (the ratio is non-zero).
