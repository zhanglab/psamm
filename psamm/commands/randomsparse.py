    """Find a random minimal network of model reactions.

    Given a reaction to optimize and a threshold, delete reactions randomly
    until the flux of the reaction to optimize falls under the threshold.
    Keep deleting reactions until no more reactions can be deleted. By default
    this uses standard FBA (not tFBA). Since the internal fluxes are irrelevant
    the FBA and tFBA are equivalent for this purpose.

    The threshold can be specified as an absolute flux (e.g. '1.23') or a
    relative flux of the full model flux (e.g. '40.5%').
